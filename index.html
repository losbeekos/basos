                        <p>Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? <strong> With gusto.</strong> <em> Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble.</em> But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</p>

                        <p class="test">Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels.
                        Bite my shiny metal ass. Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Ummm…to eBay? And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.
                        Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. A true inspiration for the children. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence?</p>
                        <p>Who are those horrible orange men? I'm Santa Claus! Yeah, lots of people did. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets?</p>
                        <p>They're like sex, except I'm having them! Perhaps, but perhaps your civilization is merely the sewer of an even greater society above you! I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe!</p>
                        <p>Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. No, I'm Santa Claus! I never loved you. Shut up and take my money!</p>
                        <p>How much did you make me? And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Shut up and get to the point! A true inspiration for the children.</p>
                        <p>I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope?</p>
                        <p>Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral!</p>
                        <p>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts! No! The cat shelter's on to me. Hello Morbo, how's the family? Tell them I hate them. Tell her she looks thin. Actually, that's still true.</p>
                        <p>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</p>
